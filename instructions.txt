Package Instruction Set

The Package can be run in major two modes

	• Pluggable Engine mode.
		○ It can be run in three modes: 
			§ Train
			§ Evaluate
			§ test
	•  Standalone testing and execution mode 
		○ It can be run in three modes:
			§ train 
			§ Evaluate
			§ Test

Environment Setup

Requirements
Install the requirements from requirements.txt file using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

File Setup
	• Need to place the package testing json in the /datasets/test.json.
	• Place the base/pretrained model in the /models.

Config.py Parameters Setup
	• Network Hyperparameters
		○ Device - "cpu" or "gpu", depending upon the hardware supported by your local machine / your choice
		○ BATCH_SIZE -> tunable for train, eval and serving.
		○ NUM_EPOCHS -> Tunable for the training process
		○ LEARNING_RATE -> Tunable for the training process
		○ MAX_LEN -> Tunable for training process
		○ TRANSFORMER_MODEL -> Selection of transformer architecture to be used
		○ ML_CLF_MODEL -> Selection of Machine Learning model to be used
	• PREPROCESS_TEXT -> Flag to preprocess text before passing to the model
	

Run commands

The script main.py is the entry point of the package execution

	• Standalone Execution
		○ Run the functional test for the package, to check all the components of the engine work correctly or not.
		○ func_test = "all" -> runs test for all the components.
		○ func_test = "train" -> runs the test for training component only.
		○ func_test = "serve" -> runs the test for serving component only.
		○ func_test = "eval" -> runs the test for evaluation component only.

python main.py --mode="package_test" --func_test="all"

	• Pluggable component
		○ This mode of running the package, showcase the capability to be able to plug in the train, eval and serving component of this module into API integration or MLOPs engine.
		○ Mode="train" - run the training component of the package.
		○ Mode="serve" - run the serving component of the package.
		○ Mode="eval" - run the evaluation component of the package.

python main.py --mode="train"

Results and Logs

	• The training results are stored in /models, when the package is run in pluggable mode whereas Testing Finetuned model is stored in the package testing mode.
	• The execution run logs after each run can be found in results/run_logs, timestamped with time of execution and date.
	• The output JSONs for the serving component can be found in the results/test_outputs.
